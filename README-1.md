## Introduction to Generative– Educloud Academy Challenge (Week 1)


This repository is part of the “Cloud & AI Builders” 30-Day Challenge organized by Educloud Academy.


## Project Documentation
I’ve completed Challenge 1 of the Cloud & AI Builders Program by Academyy — where I built an interactive educational website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) PartyRock.

The goal was to simplify and explain:

✅ The fundamentals of Generative AI
✅ What Large Language Models (LLMs) are — including GPT, Claude, etc.
✅ How Transformers became the breakthrough architecture powering modern AI.
